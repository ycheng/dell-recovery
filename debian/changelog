dell-recovery (1.24.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Backport from trunk:
    - Pass the destination as found in the SDR to target system.
    - Add an extra stanza indicating what to do with existing EFI partitions
      to workaround the regression caused by the fix to bug 855871.
    - Add support to override preseed and GRUB cmdline configurations
      for updated gfx and wlan peripherals.
    - Disable swap in very large memory configurations ( >32GB ).
    - Split out swap test to avoid code duplication (LP: #1025707)
    - Move os-prober test out of chroot section to guarantee passing
    in other scenarios.
  * Backport from driver-install-branch:
    - Don't do APT stuff with 01-jockey (not necessary anymore)
    - recovery_xml: Return all matching nodes for a tag, not just one.
    - recovery_common: Cleanup standalone files if in walk_cleanup list.
    - recovery_common: Add an environment feature to fetch_output.
    - recovery_common/dell-bootstrap: move ISO_MOUNT, CDROM_MOUNT, mark_upgrades,
      mark_unconditional_debs.
    - Introduce driver install tool and helper package format migration tool.
  * debian/control: depends on mingw-w64 rather than mingw32.
  * grub/build-binaries.sh: build 32 and 64 bit binaries.
  * precise grub patches: ignore type error for 64 bit, grub-setup.exe should
    still work and that's all we care about.
  * Don't install signed bootloaders in the OS, require that we're booted into
    them from the ISO and install from there.
  * Add a basic tool for installing a BIOS update.
  * During postinst if the BIOS update GRUB option wasn't installed during
    OOBE, add it.
  * Correct some misuses of request_mount causing crashes (LP: #1173688)
  * Modify the ubiquity desktop file to run in automatic mode too in case
    it was executed from that desktop file.
  * Set all stuff in scripts directory of a driver package executable even
    if it wasn't set as a shell script or python script.  That's what real
    factory install does too.

  [ Liu Hao-Ran ]
  * Remove nomodeset from stage to to prevent kernel oops with quantal kernels.
  * Fix typo in bootstrap.
  * Set the apt security host.
  * Add secure boot support.
  * Adjust string for dell-recovery/disable-driver-install (LP: #1103810)

  * If either an i386-pc or x86_64-efi based GRUB is found in the base image
    copy the theme in place.
  * If copying in the GRUB theme, check that the dejavu fonts are already

  * If no matching rec_part initially (blank disk) then don't crash
  * Don't build grub.cfg again if building binaries from bootstrap.
  * Query the release that we're running on to figure out whether to
    use patches for that release when building grub-setup.exe.
  * Include patches for both trunk and precise.
  * Fix file cleanup for dell-recovery-bootloader during purge.

dell-recovery (1.12) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mario Limonciello ]
  * Update bootloader patches to current grub2-trunk.
  * Add support to run GRUB2 binary builder out of tree via environment
    variables.
  * Add a 10 second countdown and automatic reboot at the end of stage 1.
  * Call emergency.sh as LAST item in casper.
  * If running in persistent mode, forcefully regenerate the apt-cache
    on boot.
  * Copy files using a blacklist excluding casper-rw rather than an all
    inclusive whitelist.  Fixes problems with persistence and dell-recovery.
  * Update the GPT utility partition creation logic.  (LP: #877858)
  * Capture the state of all packages after post install scripts to prevent
    bad interactions with remove_oem_extras after ubiquity r5804
  * Update README for more current information.
  * Don't regenerate the UUID during stage 1 anymore.  Instead, pre-populate
    the disk's UUID on the kernel command line of the target install.
    Requires casper 1.290 or later to work.
  * Add some preseeded language fixes that are reactive to casper 1.289 
    from precise and 1.287.1 from oneiric. (LP: #888298)
    - Don't preseed the language in a standard preseed file as it overrides
      casper's attempt at setting the language.
    - Don't let dell-bootstrap set language based on locale.  Only have it
      set English if no other language has been specified yet.
  * Create a flag on the disk filesystem to indicate an install is in progress.
  * Remove the casper UUID in SUCCESS_SCRIPT as well as stage 1 of recovery.
    This will prevent the RP from booting unless the UUID is present on 
    /proc/cmdline.
  * Don't include grubenv in the files that go in /factory on install media.
  * Include a grub.cfg script that will be copied into the recovery media and
    source the proper location of installs in progress.
  * Always set install_finished on completion to ensure sticks aren't booted
    again.
  * Unset install_finished when mounting the RP during OOBE.

  [ Kent Baxley ]
  * Preseed chinese installs as zh_CN.UTF-8 rather than just zh_CN.  Fixes
    translation problems for chinese factory installs. (LP: #879114)

  * In EFI installs, make sure to preseed the disk layout question to ensure
    the MBR isn't rewritten in the cleanup stages.
  * In late scripts, double check that os-prober is disabled.  On EFI installs
    GRUB gets reinstalled, so the conffile might not persist.

dell-recovery (1.03) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Move all the "code" from dell-recovery-bootloader to it's own script
    so that it can be invoked from other places too.
  * Store all GRUB configs in /factory from now.  Don't use /boot/grub
    as that's where the on disk bootloaders will land for EFI as well
    as later MBR installs.
  * Don't use grub-install at all.  Always build bootloader binaries
    ourselves that rely items in /factory.
  * Set up the FAIL and SUCCESS scripts to work out of /factory for grubenv.
  * Reinstall GRUB to the MBR on fail if fist isn't around and not EFI.
  * Add missing RP declaration in FAIL-SCRIPT.
  * Lookup the recovery partition on demand during oem-config early
    command in case the devices were different during install.
  * Depending on when FAIL_COMMAND happened, we might have mountpoints.
    Clean them up.
  * Delay the write of the new MBR until the last step in the set active
    partition command.

  * Install prebuilt GRUB to MBR and newly built GRUB to RP when possible.  
    - This allows a more complete emulation of factory process by reusing
      the prebuilt GRUB in the recovery scenario too.
    - The GRUB on the RP will only be used to RED screen after the MBR is
      replaced.
  * Only delete *.{dll|exe|bat} from /factory so that prebuilt GRUB binaries
    can be reused in other scenarios too.
  * Include the embedded GRUB configuration for prebuilt i386 and x86_efi-efi
    binaries.
  * Allow building both x86_64 and i386-pc prebuilt images if the -bin packages
    are installed for both.
  * Recommends grub-pc-bin and grub-efi-amd64-bin instead of grub-pc and

    - Copy conf files to EFI system partition when applicable.
    - Set up the GRUB graphics and terminal for EFI.
    - Drop grub-pc to Recommends on dell-recovery-bootloader, but
      offer reduced functionality in the postinst when doing so to stop the
      installer from throwing a hissy fit about removing the bootloader package.
    - Disable failsafe graphics by default when installing in EFI mode.
    - Name the EFI system partition "ESP".
  * Import translations from LP.

  * In the wizard and in bto autobuilder offer a new option to run an image in

    and also disables it after the first successful run through.
  * With several different distinct installation methods, we don't know how we
    booted necessarily.  However, for a utility partition to function, a DOS
    MBR is required by the end of install.  Test the MD5 of the first 440 bytes
    of the MBR to make sure that it's one that we support.

  * Reset the location that grub is installed and looked for on the RP
    to be /boot/grub rather than /grub.
    - This has implications for the dual boot configuration.  Now to 
      activate a reinstall, /boot/grub/grub.cfg needs to be placed on the
      recovery partition.  The logic will still prefer one on the OS paritition
      however.
    - This also means that 0.74 and later are incompatible with any earlier
      BTO frameworks.  If this is used on something earlier than 11.04, then the
      integrated BTO framework from this package should be used instead.
  * If an image already provides a grub.cfg or common.cfg in /boot/grub, back
    it up to $file.old while building a recovery partition and restore it when 
    rebuilding the image again.
  * Check that the RP is actually a Linux RP before adding to the grub.cfg.

      (RECOVERY)
  * Use udisks to find the details for the RP rather than parsing files manually
    in /dev
  * Don't install the grub.d line on all systems with dell-recovery.  Instead

      ISO images to a USB stick.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Mon, 27 Jul 2009 11:48:32 -0500

dell-recovery (0.21) karmic; urgency=low

  * boot:
    - Update to new syntax for the grub2 in Ubuntu 9.10.
  * udev:
    - Rename rule to have priority of 96.  didn't work at 95.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Wed, 22 Jul 2009 18:36:01 -0500

dell-recovery (0.20) karmic; urgency=low

  * udev:
    - Add a udev rule so that devicekit-disks will hide Dell recovery
      partitions on factory shipped Linux systems.
  * recovery_frontend:
    - Add support for devicekit-disks.  If this fails, fall back to HAL.
  * debian/control:
    - Depends on devicekit-disks or hal for system detection.
    - Drop depends on python-glade2
  * Migrate from libglade to gtkbuilder.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Wed, 22 Jul 2009 18:13:20 -0500

dell-recovery (0.19) karmic; urgency=low

  * Add a manpage showing current usage.
  * COPYING:
    - Put a copy of the GPL2, not GPL3.
  * debian/control:
    - Set maintainer to have an @ubuntu.com
    - Add bzr info.
    - Set section more sanely to utils.
    - Set standards version to 3.8.1 (no changes necessary).
    - Add a Suggests for grub-pc.  The app works fine without it, but is
      more feature-filled with it installed.
  * debian/changelog:
    - Update to be GPL2, not GPL3.

dell-recovery (0.18) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Only fill in the UP or RP variables independently if they are 
    already empty.
  * Don't offer a retry dialog in the event a burning fails.  Some burners
    don't actually have reliable return codes.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 28 Apr 2009 14:46:34 -0500

dell-recovery (0.17) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Add support for command line arguments.
  * Update string indicating recovery is complete.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Fri, 10 Apr 2009 16:28:49 -0500

dell-recovery (0.16) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Add a COPYING file w/ license for when we start to make tarballs.
  * Add a CHANGES file (which is really just a symlink to debian/changelog)
  * Detect the filesystem of the rp.  A Linux RP is vfat.  Anything else
    means that it's not an RP. (Windows RP is ntfs-3g)

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Thu, 09 Apr 2009 17:55:03 -0500

dell-recovery (0.15) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Downgrade usb-creator to Recommends
  * Add brasero | nautilus-cd-burner to Recommends.
  * Add support for not using a burner.  If none of the burning software
    above was detected, then we'll just default to creating an ISO somewhere.
  * Touch the file we are creating before actually creating it from the dbus
    backend.  This makes the file owned by the first user who touched it (Us!)
    rather than root:root from the dbus backend.
  * Add optional support to use lsb-release to show information about 
    what release this ISO is being generated for.
  * Fix a GTKWarning about a separator setting that was getting ignored.
  * Add translation support to the .desktop file.
  * Drop first run note.  It wasn't working anyway.
  * Update translations from launchpad.
  * Add missing ${misc:Depends} to debian/control.
  * Update description in debian/control.
  * Add some artwork from dell-recovery directly to this package.
  * Remove explicitly hardcoded paths from .desktop file.
  * Explicitly set icon path in glade file instead.
  * Rename all translations from dell-recovery-LANG to LANG.  See launchpad answers
    #66257 for more information.
  * Merge in grub2 bootsplash stuff to this package.  We'll only show the bootsplash
    when the package is installed.  This rids us of the last dependency on dell-artwork.
  * Update 06_dell_theme to not use deprecated methods from grub2 anymore.

dell-recovery (0.14) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Rather than calling the backend with a gksudo wrapper,
    use policy kit to authorize it's call.
  * Call the backend via an async dbus call.  The method to do this
    was borrowed from Jockey as normal async calls were mixing up
    exceptions and what not.
  * Rename progress_dialogs.glade to the more appropriate 
    recovery_media_creator.glade.
  * Check for CD and USB burning applications when initializing the UI.  If a 
    particular type isn't found, then don't allow the application to run.
  * Add 99_dell_recovery (taken from china customizations) to the install.  This
    will prepare dell-recovery for when grub2 is made default.
  * Update 99_dell_recovery to match the string that we have for grub1

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 31 Mar 2009 18:18:02 -0500

dell-recovery (0.13) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Don't enable or disable volume manager anymore.  Not necessary
    with the HAL FDI file we ship now.
  * Split up all activity between a frontend and backend script.  This
    allows the GUI to run without root priv's and the actual script to
    run with root priv's.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 24 Mar 2009 17:21:17 -0500

dell-recovery (0.12) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Cleanup an isolinux directory if it exists at the same
    time as a syslinux directory.
  * If the UP already exists, say if we are recovering from
    a recovery, no need to go and make it again.
  * Use brasero instead of nautilus-cd-burner since nautilus
    cd burner is no longer included in 9.04.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Mon, 23 Mar 2009 15:13:01 -0500

dell-recovery (0.11) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Don't build the MBR backup when creating recovery media.
    We'll dynamically create the partition table instead.
  * Don't gzip the UP.  We've plenty of space on the DVD media, so might as well
    speed up the process of backup and recovery.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 17 Mar 2009 11:46:34 -0500

dell-recovery (0.10) jaunty; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Drop dependency on menu.
  * debian/links:
    - Install actual .desktop file to /etc/skel rather than symlink.
  * import translations from launchpad.
  * Don't allow this tool to run on systems without a UP and RP.
    This is an undefined case that would likely fail anyway.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 03 Mar 2009 12:39:41 -0600

dell-recovery (0.9) jaunty; urgency=low

  * Update FDI file for changes in jaunty.

  * Add updated translations from launchpad.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 03 Feb 2009 14:38:41 -0600

  * Move syslinux.cfg if it exists to isolinux.cfg.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Tue, 25 Nov 2008 02:16:47 -0600

dell-recovery (0.4) intrepid; urgency=low

  * Allow retrying failed burns.  This works around what appears to be either
    a GTK or nautilus-cd-burner bug where nautilus-cd-burner is crashing
    immediately.
  * Clean up some warnings on startup.
  * Remove old separators that were not necessary.
  * Add taskbar hints to all relevant dialogs.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Mon, 24 Nov 2008 12:58:58 -0600

dell-recovery (0.3) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New release.
    - Move syslinux to isolinux in case we want to recover from a recovery.
  * Filter out all .sys files in / so that there aren't errors later with
    usb-creator.

 -- Mario Limonciello <mario_limonciello@dell.com>  Wed, 05 Nov 2008 13:59:32 -0600

dell-recovery (0.2) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New release.
    - Adds USB Drive support
    - Adds a popup nag dialog
  * debian/control:
    - Bump standards version
    - Depend upon usb-creator for USB support.
